Education is a powerful weapon against this; equipping young people, adults and others with the knowledge, skills and critical thinking to challenge and debate in an informed way. Therefore at Eden College we will provide a broad and balanced curriculum so that our learners are enriched, understand and become tolerant of difference and diversity and also to ensure that they thrive, feel valued and not marginalised.",

As part of our whole college e–safety programme we highlight the potential risks learners may face in relation to on–line radicalization and encourage students to report any concerns they may have for themselves or other students to their Learning and Development Adviser or the Confide system, to the Principle Learning and Development Adviser/ Managing Director.",
