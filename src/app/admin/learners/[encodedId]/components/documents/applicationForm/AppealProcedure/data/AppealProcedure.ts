  description: [
    "All learners have the right to appeal in case of concerns, disagreements and disputes about the interpretation of standards and / or an assessment decision as well as an information, advice and guidance intervention. Appeals are referred to the Centre Coordinator (the Learning and Assessment Coordinator) in the first instance who then passes this to the Internal Verifier. The Internal Verifier requires copies of all relevant material, following receipt of such, discusses the matter individually with the candidates and assessor /trainers /tutors / Careers Adviser - Consultants concerned in a formal meeting. If it is not clear to make a decision on this basis. The Internal Verifier seeks guidance from the Principal Learning and Development Adviser, being the Managing Director. The Principal Learning Development Adviser then forms a separate appeals panel to look at the case in more depth and at this point a decision is made. The panel normally consists of an independent representative agreed by the learner, a trainer/tutor or assess or who is not familiar with the learnerâ€™s work. If the dispute is still unresolved the matter is referred to the External Verifier / Chief Verifier of the awarding body concerned."
