        All learners have the right to appeal in case of concerns, disagreements
        and disputes about the interpretation of standards and / or an
        assessment decision as well as an information, advice and guidance
        intervention. Appeals are referred to the Centre Coordinator (the
        Learning and Assessment Coordinator) in the first instance who then
        passes this to the Internal Verifier. The Internal Verifier requires
        copies of all relevant material, following receipt of such, discusses
        the matter individually with the candidates and
        assessor/trainers/tutors/ Careers Adviser- Consultants concerned in a
        formal meeting. If it is not clear to make a decision on this basis. The
        Internal Verifier seeks guidance from the Principal Learning and
        Development Adviser, being the Managing Director. The Principal Learning
        Development Adviser then forms a separate appeals panel to look at the
        case in more depth and at this point a decision is made. The panel
        normally consists of an independent representative agreed by the
        learner, a trainer/tutor or assess or who is not familiar with the
        learnerâ€™s work. If the dispute is still unresolved the matter is
        referred to the External Verifier / Chief Verifier of the awarding body
        concerned.
